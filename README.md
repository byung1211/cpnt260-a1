### Code Review
	
- 2021.09.26
	
	Using the media query property to make my menu responsive, it didn't work properly with the display property. Later, I could solve the problem with !important option. FYI, my browser was Chrome and I moved to FF Dev Edition. Chrome inspector tool wasn't accurate as I expected. As I have multiple pages, I have felt I need to organize CSS class names and the structure for maintain purposes. so I spent some time doing that.

	There were many technical issues and I found the solutions through googling and MDN Docs and testing in codepen.io. (Nothing special)
